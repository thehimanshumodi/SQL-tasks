# SQL Tasks Repository

This repository serves as a collection of SQL tasks completed during my virtual internship. Each day, I'm given new SQL challenges, and this repository is where I document my solutions and progress.

## About This Repository

This project aims to showcase my learning and application of various SQL concepts, from basic data manipulation to more advanced querying techniques. It's a live record of my daily tasks and skill development in a professional environment.

## What You'll Find Here

You'll find SQL scripts demonstrating:

* **Database Definition Language (DDL):** `CREATE`, `ALTER`, `DROP` tables.
* **Data Manipulation Language (DML):** `INSERT`, `UPDATE`, `DELETE` operations.
* **Data Retrieval:** `SELECT` statements with `WHERE`, `AND`, `OR`, `LIKE`, `BETWEEN`, `ORDER BY`.
* **Aggregate Functions & Grouping:** `COUNT`, `SUM`, `AVG`, `MIN`, `MAX` with `GROUP BY` and `HAVING`.
* **Table Relationships & Joins:** `INNER`, `LEFT`, `RIGHT`, `FULL OUTER` joins for merging data from related tables.
* **Advanced Query Logic:** Scalar, Correlated, `IN`, `EXISTS`, and equality (`=`) subqueries.

Each script is commented to explain the purpose of the commands and the logic applied.

## How to Explore

Feel free to browse through the `.sql` files to see different SQL operations in action. The scripts are generally designed to be runnable in a PostgreSQL environment, but most core concepts are universally applicable.
